# Implementation Plan: E2E Testing with Playwright

## Background and Motivation

The Finance Manager application requires comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure design and functionality consistency between development and production environments. This implementation will create a robust Playwright test suite that covers all critical user workflows, implements visual regression testing, and provides confidence in deployments.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges
1. **Environment Configuration**: Setting up tests to run against both development and production environments
2. **Visual Regression**: Implementing reliable screenshot comparison that accounts for dynamic content
3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring tests work consistently across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
4. **Test Data Management**: Creating and managing test data without affecting production
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Integrating tests into GitHub Actions workflow
6. **Performance**: Ensuring test suite runs efficiently in parallel

### Application-Specific Considerations
1. **Cloudflare Worker Architecture**: Testing single-runtime application with Astro frontend
2. **Financial Data Accuracy**: Ensuring accounting calculations are tested thoroughly
3. **AI Integration**: Testing file upload and AI processing workflows
4. **Authentication**: Testing auth flows without compromising security
5. **Responsive Design**: Testing across multiple viewport sizes
