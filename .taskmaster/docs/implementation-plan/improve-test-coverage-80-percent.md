# Improve Test Coverage to 80% Minimum

## Background and Motivation

The current test suite has very low coverage across unit, integration, and e2e tests. Many core modules have 0% coverage, and existing tests are failing. We need to:

1. Fix existing failing tests
2. Improve test configuration and setup
3. Add comprehensive test coverage for all major modules
4. Achieve minimum 80% coverage for unit, integration, and e2e tests

## Current State Analysis

### Test Coverage Issues
- Most source files have 0% coverage
- Integration tests are failing due to component mocking issues
- Test configuration needs improvement
- Missing tests for critical modules:
  - Database services and schema
  - Authentication system
  - Financial calculations
  - API endpoints
  - Worker routes
  - AI services

### Existing Test Structure
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/` (3 files, basic coverage)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/` (6 files, failing)
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/` (1 file)

## Key Challenges

1. **Test Configuration**: Multiple vitest configs need consolidation
2. **Component Mocking**: React components need proper mocking setup
3. **Database Testing**: Need proper test database setup
4. **Worker Testing**: Cloudflare Workers testing environment
5. **Authentication Testing**: JWT and auth flow testing
6. **Coverage Thresholds**: Need to enforce 80% minimum

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Fix Foundation (Priority: Critical)
1. Create feature branch `improve-test-coverage-80-percent`
2. Fix vitest configuration and workspace setup
3. Fix failing integration tests
4. Set up proper test database and mocking

### Phase 2: Unit Test Coverage (Priority: High)
1. Database schema and services tests
2. Authentication system tests
3. Financial calculations and reports tests
4. AI services tests
5. Utility functions tests

### Phase 3: Integration Test Coverage (Priority: High)
1. API endpoint tests
2. Component integration tests
3. Authentication flow tests
4. Database integration tests

### Phase 4: E2E Test Coverage (Priority: Medium)
1. User authentication flows
2. Account management workflows
3. Financial reporting workflows
4. Chart of accounts management

### Phase 5: Coverage Enforcement (Priority: High)
1. Configure coverage thresholds to 80%
2. Set up CI/CD coverage gates
3. Generate coverage reports
